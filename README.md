# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the Medical X-Ray Imaging: Pneumonia Detection repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

# Project Scope of Works

## Project Overview
This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify medical X-ray images and detect pneumonia. Targeted at beginner to intermediate-level data scientists, the project will focus on leveraging deep learning techniques to develop a robust classification model. The final model will be deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## Project Objectives

### Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing:
- Use the publicly available dataset of X-ray images for model training.
- Perform data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to prepare the images for training.

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

### Model Development:
- Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Train and evaluate the model to classify X-ray images as normal or pneumonia.

### Model Deployment:
- Develop a Streamlit application to allow users to upload X-ray images and receive a prediction.
- Include visualization of prediction confidence and model explanation (e.g., Grad-CAM).

## Technical Requirements

### Tools and Libraries:
- **Dataset Handling**: Pandas, NumPy.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow.
- **Model Deployment**: Streamlit.

### Environment:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: 
  - `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `pillow`, `streamlit`, `matplotlib`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup (1 Week)
- Setup GitHub repo and project folders.
- Setup virtual environment and respective libraries.

### Phase 2: Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing (1 Week)
- Download the chest X-ray dataset from a trusted source (e.g., Kaggle).
- Explore and preprocess the dataset:
  - Resize images to a uniform size.
  - Normalize pixel values for faster model convergence.
  - Perform data augmentation to improve model generalization.

### Phase 3: Model Development (1 Week)
- Design a CNN architecture tailored for image classification.
- Train the model on the dataset with proper validation.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fine-tune the model for optimal performance.

### Phase 4: Model Deployment (1 Week)
- Build a Streamlit app to:
  - Allow users to upload X-ray images.
  - Display the model's predictions (Normal or Pneumonia).
  - Provide additional insights using Grad-CAM visualizations for explainability.

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

## 1. Fork the Repository
To work on your own copy of this project:
1. Navigate to the SDS GitHub repository for this project.  
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the repository page.  
3. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

---

## 2. Clone the Repository
After forking the repository:
1. Open a terminal on your local machine.  
2. Clone your forked repository by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

## 3. Create a virtual environment
Setup a virtual environment to isolate project dependancies
1. Run the following command in the terminal to create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment
  - On a mac/linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  - On a windows:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Verify the virtual environment is active (the shell prompt should show (.venv))

## 4. Install dependancies
Install the required libraries for the project
1. Run the following command in the terminal to isntall dependancies from the requirements.txt file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
Once the setup is complete, you can proceed with building your project
